# anki-voice
control anki with your voice
--
a little add-on I wrote for myself to use anki hands-free (such as when cooking or something)
command list: good/again/show/stop listening. customize the words for each command in `config.json`


installation:
- clone repo into addons directory
- run `build.sh`
- launch anki





warning!
with my testing on windows, running this add-on will break audio and video in cards (as in they will no longer play)
